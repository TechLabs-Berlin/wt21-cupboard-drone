The very end of November 2021. caught us completely by surprise during the expectation of what The Project Phase will bring to us, with whom and on what we'll be working in the next two months. We surely weren't expecting a bombshell which Techlabs decided for us, such as clubbing two project ideas together. It was a jaw-dropper for many and uncertainty among the just hatched team raised out of hand. We were faced with the challenge of how to merge two, at first glance, incompatible ideas! Although confused and surprised, we took the brainteaser and set off carefully unknotting the idea.

The Cupboard Champion or Dronelivery? Should we create an app whose main goal is to stop the food waste, track your food wisely and maybe even donate it to ones in need, or we should go for the (sort of a) sci-fi app idea which wants so badly to innovate the usage of drones, make them accessible (public and free) for everyone and casually cover the need for supply, demand, giving or help random people in disadvantageous times? Doubts were swarming, some spears were broken, too. So, what do these two ideas have in common? Are there any consequential weak spots? What can be their main power? Where should we put our focus on - but also, even more important, why? Is this all feasible? Yes, there were definitely some hard choices to be made. 

We were chewing it over and over and, after more than two weeks of conferring on Miro board and on the Slack channel, we decided to go with a moderated solution - a dosed merging, where drones will be a secondary feature for the app. And the minimum of requirements is finally met for the first two main features, which we narrowed by voting: a) To enable an option for the user to capture a photo of a product which will then be recognized by an AI model. The AI model would then be in a function to provide feedback about the product on a specially designed card, such as: the product name, the information about the product, the classification, the purchase date and the date of expiration, the quantity etc. The app would also be designed to provide information about the product through notifications, too; b) To offer some awesome recipe recommendations (pulled from the datasets) for the product, so it can be used wisely along with some other food, instead of just throwing it away (making it a food waste) or forgetting about it (as by habit); 

The enthusiasm has finally met the adequate level and the working atmosphere started glowing. Jhanidya, David and Raphael from the DS team jumped on the search for proper datasets for products and recipes, Palak and Parrish from the UX team started with brainstorming the list of questions for an online survey, Biljana, Hannah and I from the WD team were in charge to already put some first lines of code in traffic, to make a good base with lifting up the necessary servers and make everything prepared for the Front end steps, while Emma, as the only one from the AI team, began her work on cultivating the AI model. Even our mentor Naga, assigned by Techlabs for this very project, found a bit of his time to attend the first two meetings from far away across the ocean. No one expected it to be calm before the storm.

The Calm actually lasted for a while. The UX techies from other teams were working diligently on their surveys, on the User research & Personas and on preparing their wireframes/mockups. Our UX team was disorientated. While WD team members were patiently waiting on ideas and suggestions from the UX team, our hands were tied to go further with their work. We couldn't start introducing any first Front end solutions, we didn't have any rationalization for the app, no design nor sketches, not even colors. The silent DS members needed more time for setting up their datasets. Our mentor Naga unexpectedly stopped attending our meetings and giving much of his feedback. So the nervousness crept in perfidiously.

In the sixth week we finally got some first survey results to get to know our potential users. As well, we got a new, additional mentor Peter, who instantly offered his office hours and an open door for all of us to consult with him about the app's ideation and production. He was also regularly present during the meetings and was providing his inputs and pointers on our plans and ideas. The WD members decided to jump in and help the UX team with some ideas and hand drawn mockups. For a moment we were settled and it seemed that we were on the right path once again. 

Yet still confused, some members required a more detailed overview of how the app should look. We should've already had a user story format which would be beneficial for understanding the main idea concepts and agreeing on specific details later on. We were feverishly waiting for the UX team to create and provide some low-fidelity wireframes in Figma. We were also lacking with the information from the DS team about the datasets they found or can't find, which should've give a precise answer on the app features that will be covered with them, and which ones we'll have to connect with API's or, in worst scenario, fulfill with some hardcore fake data. WD team members didn't know if and what for the DS team would use the potential DB server. The project sank into hibernation and left it to stand on glass legs.

Holidays were over and it was time to get back to business. We were already deep into the first week of January and we still didn't have much from our app! Biljana from the WD team simply vanished. There was also no voice nor trace from the DS team in a continuum of almost two weeks. Midterms date was approaching and I seriously started wondering if we're gonna be able to deliver anything on time. But sometimes silence is the answer. The silence was so strong that we needed to think of applying some kind of shock therapy as soon as possible. Thus, the rest of the WD team started announcing the deadlines for the deliverance and tagging the silent members of other teams on the public channel, asking them if they are still on the project. And as a result, immediately after the Midterms presentation, the whole DS team decided to inform us that they'll drop out. In the meantime, after some long waiting, the UX team presented their first wireframe which was, as it turned out, created as a mobile first. We definitely needed a desktop version prototype first, as previously agreed. So, out of a sudden our team just halved and we were knee-deep into the problem.

The Storm came out of the blue. We had to accelerate and reorganize everything with less than three weeks until the Finals. Hannah jumped into the project management role, because she was unable to pull through to the project due to other commitments outside the project, so Emma and I set out to work on the app on our own. In order to implement a feature in our app that allows the user to upload an image and have it recognize a variety of vegetables and fruits, Emma created a convolutional neural network using data augmentation on the [**Grocery Store image dataset**] (https://github.com/marcusklasson/GroceryStoreDataset) , which contains natural images of grocery items: 15 categories of vegetables and 19 categories of fruits. Satisfactory predictions were successfully achieved by using a pre-trained model (Resnet50). On the other side, I was able to build the whole Front end for the app using React and Styled Components. The last days brought the definite dropping out of the UX team, so I needed an urgent solution for our logo. As someone with (still) very basic knowledge of design in general, as a Linux user who doesn't have access to the Adobe family and as someone who, without avail, tried to find an easy and free solution over the internet, I couldn't think of anything else but to use some creativity and make it from the icon. And it worked perfectly! After I made it responsive, we only had some time left to connect the Front end with the AI model. With no more time left, we also had to cut off all the other planned features, even though Emma made it to prepare a dataset which would be used for the recipes recommendations.

Hooking the React server (which is a connection to the Front end) with the Flask server (behind which waits Emma's AI model to be activated) was very much a toughie. Primarily, I had a long romance with installing the missing dependencies for running the AI model in my local repository (I have never used Python before that day). Next, it was in the cards to edit the code (let me double mention that it was written in Python) so I would be able to connect Emma's model to the React server later. Axios library came as very handy for sending the HTTP requests to the REST endpoints. But I was stuck for a few long days with the response.data (an object built into the Javascript). It was tricky to figure out how to connect the response.data to the specific React component. Beside that, figuring out the form.data from React to Python was challenging because I wasn't familiar with the Python syntax, so I didn't figure out that it was called differently - request.files. 

With the little help of my friend (hint: a famous search engine) I succeeded in solving the matter, but it devoured all of my disposable time. The sand from the clock ran out and it was time for us to wrap it up. We decided to round it up with that one feature and stay satisfied with what we were able to carry out until the very end with significantly reduced forces.

Still, we have some big plans. The vision for the future would be to grow the number of images and labels to include more fresh items, such as meat and fish. It would be nice to have some other previously planned features, such as recipes recommendation which we were short to own for just a little, or an option for the app to recognize the products over barcodes, or to have an alternative to donate the food which users don't want or need to the food banks (hopefully with those drones I've mentioned at the beginning of this blog), and many many more…

Dreams are big, but our experience is even bigger. It was an exciting adventure despite all the circumstances and unexpected events. In the end, we are amazed with what we were able to make in this short span of time and with the great power that technology hides under the vest. Thank you, Techlabs Berlin!
