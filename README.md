# **The Cupboard**

## **The Cupboard** is here to offer a smart way of using food products, preventing the food to be wasted. This app tracks your products and notifies you if a product is going to expire soon. The app offers an option to donate your food to the food banks or directly to the ones in need. Believe it or not, the delivery is maintained with drones!
